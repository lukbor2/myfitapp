How to start the django app:

python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT

******************************************

How to start MySQL (at the end I did NOT use MySQL on C9)

# start MySQL. Will create an empty database on first start
$ mysql-ctl start

# stop MySQL
$ mysql-ctl stop

# run the MySQL interactive shell
$ mysql-ctl cli

You can then connect to the database with following parameters:

    Hostname - $IP (The same local IP as the application you run on Cloud9)
    Port - 3306 (The default MySQL port number)
    User - $C9_USER (Your Cloud9 user name)
    Password - “” (No password since you can only access the DB from within the workspace)
    Database - c9 (The database username)


To verify your hostname, you can connect to the mysql cli and show the host by running the following commands:

mysql-ctl cli


In my case I know that my root user is:

lukbor2

and the database name is:

c9

And my hostname is:

lukbor2-myfitapp-5975123
