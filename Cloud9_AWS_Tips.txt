*** IN GENERAL ***

After creating the environment, without doing anything I have python3.6 and Django 2.
To use python3.6 in the command line remember to use

python3

Furthermore, when using pip to work on the python3.6 environment remember to use the command

sudo pip-3.6

*** LAUNCH THE DJANGO DEV SERVER ***

python3 manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT

Then a link will be available to get a tab with the app running.

*** DATABASE ***

To keep things simple with AWS I use SQLite; so remember to change the DATABASES in settings.py .
